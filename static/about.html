    <h1>About</h1>
    <h2 id="bradley-wright">Bradley Wright</h2>
    <div class="vcard">
        <p>
            <span class="fn"><span class="given-name">Bradley</span> <span class="family-name">Wright</span></span> (<span class="nickname">Brad</span> to most people), is a professional web developer living and working in <span class="adr"><span class="locality">London</span>, <span class="country-name">United Kingdom</span></span>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently he works as <span class="title">Director of Web Development</span> at <a href="http://smarkets.com/" class="org">Smarkets</a>, a London-based online betting exchange. The Director bit doesn’t mean much right now, since we’re a tiny startup—but don’t let that put you off being impressed!
        </p>
    </div>
    <p>
        When asked to describe himself for a conference, he used the following paragraph:
    </p>
    <blockquote cite="http://hackdaylondon07.backnetwork.com/speakers/#s18"><p>
        Bradley Wright, never one for stereotypes, is an Australian living in London. Having graduated from the shady realms of speed-dating web sites, he now works for Yahoo! as a web developer on Yahoo! Answers. Brad enjoys electronic music, reading, beer, and being photographed with beer.
    </p></blockquote>
    <p>
        …which he thinks is a pretty neat summary. Except now he’d add cycling to his interests. And obviously I don’t work at Yahoo! any more.
    </p>
    <p>
        Brad can also be found on <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/intranation" rel="me">Flickr</a>, <a href="http://www.dopplr.com/traveller/intranation" rel="me">Dopplr</a>, <a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/user/45790/" rel="me">Upcoming</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/intranation" rel="me">Twitter</a> (when it’s working), and <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/intranation/" rel="me">Last.FM</a>, mostly under the handle “intranation”. He guarantees this is the only page where the third (grammatical) person will be used.
    </p>
    <h2 id="website">This site</h2>
    <p>
        This site is built using the <a href="http://python.org/">Python</a>-based framework <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>. The process was somewhat painless and straight–forward, and will be documented at great length in the name of helping others.
    </p>
    <p>
        It’s built with web standards and accessibility best–practices in mind, and should ideally validate as <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> 4.01 Strict at all times. All parts of the site should also be accessible via keyboard and/or with Javascript switched off.
    </p>
    <h2 id="contact">Contacting me</h2>
    <p>
        I’ve been told I’m very hard to get in touch with, so here’s how to reach me via email: <var>brad [at] this domain</var>.
